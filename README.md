# Stopwatch
I made a Stopwatch using HTML, CSS and JS
This is a basic stopwatch project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project has a simple design with buttons for start, stop, and reset that allow the user to control the stopwatch.

Usage:
To use the stopwatch, open the clock.html file in your preferred browser. As soon as the website loads, the stopwatch begins to tick. 
Click the Start button to begin the stopwatch. Click the Stop button to halt the stopwatch. Click the Reset button to reset the stopwatch.

Customization:
The project features a straightforward design that may be readily changed with CSS. 
The project's styles can be found in the clock.css file. You can change the stopwatch's colours, fonts, and layout to suit your preferences.
